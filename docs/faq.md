# FAQ

**Does it clear social caches?**
No. Use each platform’s debugger to trigger re-scrapes. See `docs/cache-busting.md`.

**Why do I get 403s?**
Some sites block bots or WAFs block crawler user agents. The tool reports that directly.

**Which crawlers are supported?**
LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. See `docs/crawler-profiles.md`.
